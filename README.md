# RohmMultiSensor

## Arduino library for ROHM Sensor Evaluation Kit

DISCLAIMER: This library is provided 'AS IS'. See `license.txt` for details.

This library is an alternative to the libraries provided by ROHM. See [ROHM webpage](http://www.rohm.com/web/global/sensor-shield-support) for details on the ROHM Sensor Evaluation Kit.

Main purpose of this library is to allow easier, more lightweight interfacing with ROHM sensors.

When using all currently supported sensors with RohmMultiSensor and a simple serial output, the sketch after compilation (for Arduino UNO) uses 20% less program storage space and 30% less dynamic memory that the libraries provided by ROHM need!

Furthemore, RohmMultiSensor is a single library, as opposed to ROHM-provided one-library-per-sensor.

Finally, this library is compliant with Arduino IDE 1.5 specification.

## Basic usage
The following is a list of currently supported sensors:

* KX022_1020
* BM1383GLV
* BM1422GMV
* RPR_0521RS
* BH1745NUC
* BD7411G
* BD1020HFV
* ML8511A
* BH1790GLC

For any sensor that will be used in the Arduino sketch, the following has to be defined BEFORE the library header file inclusion. The `<sensor_name>` is the same as in the list above.

```c++
#define INCLUDE_<sensor_name>
//possible another sensor definitions

#include <RohmMultiSensor.h>
```

For example, if you want to interface with KX022-1020 accelerometer and BM1383 pressure sensor, your Arduino sketch will begin like this:

```c++
#define INCLUDE_KX022_1020
#define INCLUDE_BM1383GLV

#include <RohmMultiSensor.h>
```

IMPORTANT: You will not be able to use any sensors for which you have not provided the `#define`! This is to ensure that only the required sensors are included, reducing overall program size.

Alternatively, you can `#define` all the sensors that share the same supply voltage. In this example, we will include all sensors that run on 1.8 V:

```c++
#define INCLUDE_ALL_1V8_SENSORS

#include <RohmMultiSensor.h>
```

Other possibilities are: `INCLUDE_ALL_3V0_SENSORS` or `INCLUDE_ALL_5V0_SENSORS` for 3 V or 5 V sensors.

Every sensor's class has to be instantiated before use. The class name is the same as the sensor name used in the list of the supported sensors. If we continue with the example:

```c++
#define INCLUDE_KX022_1020
#define INCLUDE_BM1383GLV

#include <RohmMultiSensor.h>

KX022_1020 acc;
BM1383 bar;
```

After the instantiation, in the Arduino `setup()` function, each sensor has to be initialized. This is done by calling `.init()` method for each of the sensors. Since KX022 uses interrupts, we will also define interrupt service routine (ISR). See [Important notes](#important-notes) for details on interrupt settings.
Also, because some of the sensors use I2C (aka TWI) interface, be sure to add `Wire.begin()` BEFORE the `.init()` initialization!

```c++
#define INCLUDE_KX022_1020
#define INCLUDE_BM1383GLV

#include <RohmMultiSensor.h>

KX022_1020 acc;
BM1383 bar;

void acc_isr(void) {
  acc.setFlagDrdy();
}

void setup() {
  Wire.begin();
  
  acc.init(acc_isr);
  bar.init();
}
```

The `.init()` method returns 0 on successful initialization or 1 in case the initialization fails, this can be used to catch any errors that may occur.
This (default) initialization should work in most cases, but in case you need to change any of the sensors' settings, please refer to the [Library reference](#library-reference) on details of how to correctly initialize each of the supported sensors.

After all the sensor have been succefully initialized, you can access their data by calling `.measure()` method.
Please note that the return data types vary for each of the sensors, for details on all of them, please refer to the [Library reference](#library-reference).

```c++
#define INCLUDE_KX022_1020
#define INCLUDE_BM1383GLV

#include <RohmMultiSensor.h>

KX022_1020 acc;
BM1383 bar;

void acc_isr(void) {
  acc.setFlagDrdy();
}

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println();
  
  Wire.begin();
  
  acc.init(acc_isr);
  bar.init();
}

void loop() {
  float* accelValue = acc.measure();
  float pressValue = bar.measure();
  
  //use the values measured above here
  Serial.println(accelValue[0]);
  Serial.println(accelValue[1]);
  Serial.println(accelValue[2]);
  Serial.println(pressValue);
  
  delete[] accelValue;
  delay(100);
}
```

## Important notes
1. When using the BD7411G Hall sensor, be sure to disconnect the sensor from the shield before uploading the sketch!
  Since BD7411G's OUT pin is directly connected to Arduino D0 (serial RX), any attempt to upload with the sensor connected will lead to avrdude: stk500_getsync() error.
  
2. The interrupt settings on the shield are following:  
  * J3 jumper connects interrupts to Arduino interrupt 0 (pin D2)  
  * J4 jumper connects interrupts to Arduino interrupt 1 (pin D3)  
  * INTRx pins on J3 and J4 are used to connect CMOS output interrupts for sensors KX022_1020 and BM1422GMV on header I2C_x  
  * INTx pins on J3 and J4 are used to connect interrupts which require external pull-up, these are for sensors BH1745NUC and RPR-0521RS on header I2C_x  
  * J16 jumper is ON/OFF switch for the pull-up, when shorted, it will be ON: the pull-up resistor is 1kΩ, the logic HIGH will be 5V.
  
  Currently, interrupts are implemented in BM1422GMV magnetometer and KX022-1020 accelerometer.
  
  Example: If we want to use the BM1422GMV magnetometer, we can connect it to the header I2C_1. Since BM1422GMV doesn't need an external pull-up, we can directly short INTR1 on J3 if we want to use Arduino interrupt 0 (default setting), or INTR1 on J4 if we want to use Arduino interrupt 1. See `/examples/BM1422GMV` for details.
  
  IMPORTANT: The number of interrupt pin INTRx and INTx DOES NOT correspond to number of I2C slot!
  The correct mapping is the following:
  * INTR1 and INT1 are connected to I2C_1
  * INTR2 and INT2 are connected to I2C_4
  * INTR3 and INT3 are connected to I2C_2
  * INTR4 and INT4 are connected to I2C_5
  * INTR5 and INT5 are connected to I2C_3
  
  If you want to use for example KX022-1020 and BM1422GMV together, you can connect KX022-1020 to I2C_1 and short INTR1 on J3. In code, you will then use Arduino interrupt 0 (INT_0). The BM1422GMV can be connected to I2C_2. Then you have to short INTR4 on J4 and use Arduino interrupt 1 (INT_1). See `/examples/all1V8Sensors` for working example.
  
  Because the shield only allows you to connect 2 interrupts at a time, you can't use more than two interrupt-driven sensors ata the same time. Because of that, most sensors provide interrupt-free functionality, and only use interrupts for special functions (except for BM1422GMV and KX022-1020, which are entirely interrupt-driven).

3. When using the BH1790GLC, make sure that you are not trying to read the data faster than the `readCycle` frequency. For example, if you leave the default value, you have to wait at least 1/32 seconds before accessing the sensor again.
