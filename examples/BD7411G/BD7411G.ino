/*
 * BD7411G example
 * 
 * This sketch shows you how to detect magnetic field using BD7411G
 * 
 * Before powering up your Arduino, make sure to select 5V on jumper J15 on the shield!
 * 
 * NOTE: When using this sensor, be sure to disconnect it before uploading the sketch.
 *       BD7411G outputs HIGH if no magnetic field is present.
 *       Because this sensor is connected directly Arduino D0 (Serial RX),
 *       any attempt to upload with the sensor connected will lead to avrdude: stk500_getsync() error!
